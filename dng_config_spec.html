<section id="operations">
  <h2>Supported Operations on Delivery Session Resources</h2>
  <p>DNG supports the following operations on delivery session resources:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>GET: Retrieve the state of a delivery session resource.</li>
    <li>PUT: Update the state of a delivery session resource;  Changing the delivery state of a delivery session will cause the server to
    commence the delivery operation.</li>
    <li>DELETE: Delete the specified delivery session resource.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section id="put_operation">
  <h3>Behaviour of PUT</h3>
    A PUT which attempts to make an invalid state transition will respond with 409 Conflict.
    <p>
	Changing the delivery state of a session to <code>dng_config:delivered</code> will cause the server to begin processing the
	delivery of changes from the source to the target.  This may take some time.
	<p>
	If that delivery session is already in the process of being delivered, the response to the PUT will be 409 Conflict.
	<p>
	The server MAY respond with an error code, or, 200 OK, or it MAY respond with a 202 Accepted, indicating that the delivery
	operation may take some time and is being processed in the background.
	<p>
	In case of 202 response, the server will continue processing the delivery asynchronously. Clients SHOULD poll the delivery
	session resource until such times as the server responds with a code indicating that the processing is complete.
	
 <ul>
    <li>200 OK: The delivery was completed.  The representation in the body will indicate that the state of the session.
    In case of a successful delivery, the state will be <code>dng_config:delivered</code>; in case of an unsuccessful delivery, it will
    be in some other state.</li>
    <li>410: The delivery session is no longer available.  This can happen when the delivery fails in such a way that
    the session cannot be recovered.  The body of the response MAY include a description of any delivery failures.</li>
    <li>404: The delivery session is no longer available.</li>
  </ul>
