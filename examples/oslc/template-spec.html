		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p><em>A simple introduction. It would be good if the reader ended the
			introduction knowing what the spec does, even a simple key example
			(even detailed copy-n-paste sample a developer would use). I decent example
			is the <a href="https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/ldpwg/raw-file/ldpatch/ldpatch.html#introduction">LD Patch intro section</a>.</em></p>

		<h2>Motivation</h2>

			motivated this specification. References are good, especially to
			some Use Case and Requirements.</em></p>
	</section>
	
	<section id='concepts' class='informative'>
		<h2>Basic Concepts</h2>
		<p><em>Optional section, though could be useful if intro can't cover it and you have enough concepts
			that it is worth elaborating on.  A reasonable example is the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld/#basic-concepts">JSON-LD Syntax spec</a>.</em></p>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h2>Capability</h2>
		<p><em>The title of this section is flexible.  Since the title of this spec should match what it does, it 
		may not make sense to repeat it here.  This section is intended to capture the conformance clauses 
		(ie, the 'meat' of the spec).</em></p>
		
		<section id="clause">
			<h2>Clause section</h2>
			<p><em>Give your section title/id something meaningful and simple, don't include the actual section number.</em></p>
			<p><em><strong>Writing conformance clauses/statements: </strong> Create individual sections for each conformance clause.
			Each clause should cleanly map to a test case, see [[LDP]] spec and <a href="http://w3c.github.io/ldp-testsuite">LDP testsuite</a> for an example of this model.</em></p>
			
			<section id="clausea"><h2 class="normal">
				OSLC specifications MUST provide [[RFC2116]] keywords that SHOULD be in ALL CAPS and MAY include client and/or server needs.

			<section id="clauseb"><h2 class="normal">
				It is RECOMMENDED that OSLC specifications include examples whenever possible.

			<h2>Shape</h2>
			<p><em>For every resource that is defined, define a shape for it.  There may need to be
			a shape for certain scenarios. Shapes are intended to be published as separate files and 
			consumed by other applications.  Shapes must be an external Turtle file
			(.ttl) and included.  We hope to have some code that will convert it into an HTML table, or other 
			visually pleasing forms as needed.</em></p>

			<h2>Discovery</h2>
			<p><em>This section details how OSLC clients can discover this capability.  It should follow the model
			set by [[LDP]] and [[OSLCCore3]].  Depending on the capability, it could be defined using existing
			HTTP headers, HTTP OPTIONS response, content in responses such as a predicate that links a ldp:Container
			to some other kinds of resource (such as type URL or shape), and so on.</em></p>

		<h2>RDF Vocabulary</h2>
